title: Incorrect cleanup of network resources
description: >
     When terminating the application unexpectedly by e.g. Ctrl-C,
     then the network resources are not properly released. If
     restarting the program immediately, then the same network ports
     might not be available for use and this cause exceptions to be
     thrown. This can be fixed by adding a cleanup function.
classification: >
  CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release #RESOURCE
  internal classification (cause): no proper cleanup of network resources
