title: Incorrect parsing of RAPID record data
description: >
     When using Robot Web Services (RWS) to read RAPID record data,
     then the values are represented in a string format contatined
     between '[' and ']' and delimited by ',' characters. E.g. [TRUE,
     "text string 1", 0.1] The problem occurs when the text string
     contains e.g. delimiter characters.
