title: Incorrect parsing of multiple RWS content
description: >
     When using Robot Web Services (RWS) to extract resources from the
     different RWS services, then some of the resources might contain
     several interesting items. E.g. if asking for all mechanical
     units in the current robot system there might be more than
     one. The current parsing solution works best when extracting a
     single item, if there are multiple items then it is
     cumbersome. This can be solved by adding a proper XML and/or JSON
     parser.
