title: New features unavailable in older systems
description: >
     When adding the possibility to use features that have been added
     in new versions of Robot Web Services (RWS), then it will not be
     possible to use them with older systems. Currently, if using an
     older system version, then this will be attempted and reported as
     a failed communication. It might be prudent to check the current
     system's version and then report if a specific function is
     unavailable.
