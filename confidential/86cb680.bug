title: Possibly inconclusive result when asking for RWS data
description: >
     When using Robot Web Services (RWS) to ask the robot controller
     if a certain condition is true or false, then the current
     solution report false for all cases except when the data was
     received correctly and parsed to true. E.g. a network failure
     would mean that the condition is reported as false. In such cases
     it is more prudent to report the condition as unknown. This can
     be done by using a tri state Boolean as output instead of a
     normal bool.
classification: >
  Incorrect Data Parsing (no CWE)
  internal classification (cause): inconclusive result if e.g. communication failure
