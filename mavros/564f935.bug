title: Incorrect argument name and positional->keyword argument
description: >
     This commit fixes two bugs in the "mavros/scripts/mavcmd" script:

     The first bug is on lines 278 and 279. These lines implement '-e'
     and '-d' command-line flags, which are used to enable and disable
     the camera trigger. The buggy version of these lines incorrectly
     saves the state of these flags to the "enable" attribute of the
     arguments object. The code which handles the state of this flag
     is on line 191, and expects the flag to be saved to
     "trigger_enable".

     The second bug is on line 191. The buggy implementation
     incorrectly passes the state of the "trigger_enable" flag to
     "command.trigger_control" as its first (and only) positional
     argument. The "command.trigger_control" function expects the flag
     to be passed as its "trigger_enable" argument.
