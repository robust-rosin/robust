title: set_mode service always returns true, regardless of success
description: >
     The "set_mode" service provides the user (and the system itself)
     with the means of requesting a change of mode for the robot
     (e.g., manual to autonomous navigation). This service call
     accepts the desired mode as its sole argument, and should return
     a boolean flag, indicating whether the request was successful, in
     which case True is returned, or if the request failed, in which
     case False is returned. In practice, however, calls to this
     service always return True, even when the requested mode change
     was unsuccessful.

     Closer inspection of the code reveals that no checking is
     performed by the service handler, and that the success flag is
     hardcoded as True.
