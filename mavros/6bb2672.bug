title: Weak if-condition causes incorrect control flow
description: >
     The "passthrough" timesync mode is used when synchronisation
     between MAVROS and MAVLink is not required; e.g., in cases where
     both are running on the same physical machine. In cases where
     passthrough is used, a new ROS::Time instance should be generated
     by adding the current offset, stored in "time_offset". The buggy
     version of the code fails to apply this offset, and thus returns
     incorrect timestamps.
