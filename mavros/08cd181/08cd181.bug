title: Missing include in mavconn interface.h
description: >
     A missing header, "boost/make_shared.hpp", prevented the ROS
     Hydro-release from building.  This regression was brought about
     as a result of moving MAVConn to its own package.
     A missing header is a general issue that could appear in any C++ project.
