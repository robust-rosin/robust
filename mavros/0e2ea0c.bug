title: Inefficient checking for string emptiness using empty() rather than size()
description: >
     This commit performs two small performance/hygiene-related fixes
     to the code, discovered using the cppcheck static analyser. The
     first fix replaces code that checks a string is empty by ensuring
     its length is greater than zero with a call to ".empty()".

     (The commit also contains a minor optimization: an argument of
     the "send_any_path_command" function has been optimized to now
     be passed as string by reference, rather than by value.)
