title: Missing parameter in ROS service call
description: >
     The "do_long" function in the "mavcmd" script accepts an object
     that describes a MAVLink command.  Command objects are supplied
     with seven arguments, which may be used or ignored by the command
     handler depending on the type of command. The "do_long" function
     dispatches this command object to the "mavros.command.long"
     function. which forwards the command to MAVLink. Rather than
     accepting positional arguments, the "mavros.command.long" accepts
     all of its arguments as keywords. Missing keywords are assumed to
     be irrelevant and substituted by a nominal placeholder value.

     The buggy implementation of this function fails to pass along the
     seventh argument during the call to "mavros.command.long",
     causing incorrect information to be forwarded to MAVLink. This
     bug will only manifest for commands which utilise all seven
     arguments.
