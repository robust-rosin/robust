title: Missing assignment during construction of JointState object
description: >
     The "ServoStatePublisher" class is used to publish the state of
     the robot's joints to the "joint_states" topic. The "rc_out_cb"
     method is used to describe these states (as
     sensor_msgs::JointState objects). Following the (implicit)
     construction of a JointState object (via
     "boost::make_shared<sensor_msgs::JointState>();"), "rc_out_cb"
     assigns appropriate values to each of the fields of this
     object. However, "rc_out_cb" fails to assign a timestamp value to
     the header of the JointState object. Therefore, any subscribers
     which rely on this timing information will behave incorrectly.
