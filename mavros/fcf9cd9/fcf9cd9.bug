title: Uninitialised variable causes incorrect timestamps to be produced
description: >
     The UAS manager, defined in uas_data.cpp, is responsible for
     describing the state of the robot. This description includes the
     current position and orientation of the robot, its capabilities,
     connection status, and more. Part of this manager also records a
     time offset between MAVROS and MAVLink, which is used to maintain
     synchronisation. A bug in the constructor fails to initialise the
     attribute responsible for recording this offset (time_offset),
     causing incorrect timestamps to be produced.
