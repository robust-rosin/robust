title: Retry counter isn't decremented, leading to infinite loop
description: >
     The "ParamPlugin" class is used to allow users to read and
     manipulate parameter values. When an incorrect parameter index is
     used to fetch the value of a parameter, the plugin reports a
     warning to ROS and (should) decrement a retry counter. The retry
     counter allows the user to attempt to fetch the value of a given
     parameter up to three times in a row. When an access request
     fails, the program will attempt to fetch the parameter until the
     retry counter has expired. A bug in the code prevents the retry
     counter from being decremented correctly, causing the plugin to
     query the parameter value indefinitely.
