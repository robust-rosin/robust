title: Missing ENU->NED frame conversion in send_attitude_target
description: >
     The "send_attitude_target" function in "setpoint_attribute.cpp"
     accepts a 3D affine transformation (along with a timestamp), and
     forwards an attitude target to MAVLink via the lower-level
     "send_attitude_target" in "setpoint_attribute.cpp". Amongst other
     parameters, the lower-level function accepts attitude as a size 4
     array of floats, representing a quaternion. The (buggy)
     higher-level function converts the affine transformation to a
     quarternion in the ENU frame, but fails to convert the resulting
     quaternion to the NED frame expected by the lower-level frame.
