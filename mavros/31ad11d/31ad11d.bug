title: OSX compilation failure due to library incompatibilities
description: >
     The libmavconn module fails to compile on OSX due to library
     incompatibilities in thread_utils.h. Specifically, the
     pthread_setname_np function defined in pthread.h implements a
     different interface for OSX and (tested) Linux systems. On OSX,
     this function sets the name of the calling thread to a given (C)
     string; on Linux, the function also accepts the pthread_t object
     of the thread which should be renamed.
