title: Incorrect string length
description: >
     On line 210 of "sys_status.cpp", the contents of a decoded
     message (represented by a std::string) are copied to a local
     std::string variable, "text". The parameters for the
     initialisation of the "text" variable are intended to accept the
     contents of the original message string, and the number of
     characters within the string. The original, buggy code
     incorrectly passes the size of the message string in bytes rather
     than in characters. The fixed version of the code determines the
     number of characters in the decoded message using the "strnlen"
     function.
