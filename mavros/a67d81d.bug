title: Missing type conversion in u8->hex conversion
description: >
     The "array_to_hex_string" helper function in "sys_status.cpp"
     accepts an array of uint8_t (along with an argument specifying
     its size), and returns a hexadecimal string describing the
     contents of the array. The faulty implementation of this function
     performs this conversion by passing the raw uint8_t to an
     ostringstream object; the ostringstream operates on the bits of
     uint8_t as if it were an int, producing an incorrect result. The
     fixed version of this function explicitly converts the uint8_t to
     an int before passing it to the ostringstream.
