title: Incorrect ROS build files (e.g., CMakeLists.txt, package.xml)
description: >
     The build files for the MAVROS project are missing several pieces
     of information, and use an incorrect, deprecated namespace in
     several instances:

     - The "package.xml" file, used to describe MAVROS as a ROS
     package, was missing a build-time dependency, "std_msgs".

     - Several types in the ROS message and service description files
     (.msg and .srv) use an incorrect namespace ("mavros", rather than
     "mavros_msgs").

     - The "geometry_msgs" dependency is also missing from
     "CMakeLists.txt"
