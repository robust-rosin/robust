title: Missing tcpclient lock
description: >
id: 1f01916
     The "MAVConnTCPServer::client_closed" method is responsible for
     safely closing a given client's connection to the TCP server. In
     the buggy implementation of this method, the lock for the
     client (represented as a pointer to an MAVConnTCPClient
     instance) was not acquired before closing the connection,
     leading to a possible race condition that can result in
     deadlocking or a segmentation fault.
