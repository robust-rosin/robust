title: Possible array overrun
description: >
     The function "MAVConnInterface::new_channel" in
     "mavconn_interface.cpp" is used to establish a new communications
     channel, and to return the index of that channel to the
     caller. To the channel that should be opened for communications,
     the "new_chanel" function iterates through each of the available
     channels using a range-based for-loop. At each step in the loop,
     the program checks to see whether the numbered channel is
     currently in use; if the channel is free, the index for that
     channel is added to the "allocated_channels" set before being
     returned to the caller. A typo in the for-loop invariant caused
     an off-by-one error, where the program would check to see whether
     a non-existent channel is available. In this case, the
     non-existent channel, with index "MAVLINK_COMM_NUM_BUFFERS",
     would be added to the set and returned to the user. Subsequent
     accesses to this channel could then result in an array overrun,
     or cause unexpected program behaviour.
