title: New PX4 drone now acknowledges sent commands
description: >
     A newer version of the PX4 autopilot module now sends an
     acknowledgement signal upon receiving a command, unlike all
     previous versions. To ensure proper functioning, the
     "send_command_long_and_wait" function, responsible for issuing
     commands to the drone should be updated to expect acknowledgement
     from the drone (autopilot).
