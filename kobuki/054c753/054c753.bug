title: Terminal Becomes Unresponsive Due To Uninitialized Objects
description: >
     Sometimes, the logging functions of ROS would misbehave, for
     instance printing all text in capital letters. Additionally, the
     terminal would become unresponsive, ignoring Ctrl+C signals to
     shutdown the application.
     Kobuki uses a serial port to communicate between the robot itself
     and the computer running ROS. To handle the serial port
     communication, the `serial` API from the `ecl_devices` library
     package is used.  The developer's idea is to set the reading mode
     to blocking (synchronous).  However, the `block(timeout)`
     function is called before the `Serial` object is fully
     initialized (via the `open` function).
     Setting the blocking mode on an uninitialized `Serial` object
     will try to manipulate a file descriptor that is only initialized
     with the `open` function. In short, calling the functions in the
     wrong order leads to using uninitialized values, causing the
     wrong behaviour.
