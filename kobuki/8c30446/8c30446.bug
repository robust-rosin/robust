title: Referencing Wrong Parameter File
description: >
     A launch file was referencing a data file from another repository
     to initialize ROS parameters.
     Launch files are XML files that declare a sequence of nodes for
     the ROS platform to execute. Launch files can also declare ROS
     parameters to be loaded to the ROS parameter server (key-value
     pairs). In particular, the `rosparam` tag is a shortcut to load a
     series of parameters from an YAML file.
     Referencing data files from other repositories is arguably not
     recommended, because they may change or disappear unexpectedly,
     besides introducing additional dependencies. Additionally, the
     defective launch file is in the Kobuki repository, and
     referencing a file in the Turtlebot repository.  From a logic
     standpoint, it is Turtlebot that builds upon Kobuki, and not the
     other way around. Kobuki is a base, Turtlebot is the entire
     robot.

     The fix consisted on creating a file with the required data
     within the Kobuki repository.

        An issue surfaced when building the docker image, as it could
        not find tf2 packages. This was due to the repository being named
        `geometry_experimental` at the time this issue was reported, and
        having been renamed to `geometry2` later on. To fix this, the
        rosinstall file had to be patched manually. Cf. issue
        https://github.com/robust-rosin/robust/issues/63.

        Regarding the test case, the strategy is very straightforward.
        Since the bug is related to the use of data files from other packages
        within a launch file (thus, creating unnecessary dependencies),
        the test script just has to parse the XML launch file, find the
        `rosparam` tag (which loads the file), and check that the fixed
        version no longer uses a file from another package (in this case,
        `turtlebot_bringup`).
