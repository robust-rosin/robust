title: Robot Getting Stuck When Auto-docking
description: >
     Kobuki is a mobile robot base that is used mainly for version 2
     of Turtlebot, but there are some other uses for it with heavier
     payloads.
     The movement speeds were hard-coded for the auto-docking
     algorithm, and worked well for regular Kobuki and Turtlebot, but
     were too slow for heavier robots, causing them to get stuck.
     To solve this issue, the minimum speed limits had to be
     configurable.
