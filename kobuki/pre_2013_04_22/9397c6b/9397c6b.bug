title: Misaligned or Overflowed Buffer
description: >
     Sometimes, when reading serial data, the Kobuki driver would find
     the buffer to be overflowed (missing data) or misaligned
     (including unintended bits of data).
     This showed up when using formatters to convert the byte buffer
     to a convenient string representation.
     The main problem was in the formatters, and not in the Kobuki
     driver.  It consumed data always from index zero, even though
     sometimes it should start from a greater index.
