title: Converting Nodes to Nodelets
description: >
     ROS provides the concepts of node and nodelet. Nodes are the main
     entities, using OS processes and communicating through the
     network.  Nodelets are an optimization construct meant for nodes
     that are tightly coupled. They use threads instead, managed by a
     process called the nodelet manager.
     The big advantage of nodelets is that communication can happen by
     sharing references to the messages in memory, instead of going
     through serialization of every message sent.
     Kobuki features a number of nodes that are tightly coupled, and
     communicate at a reasonable frequency. Thus, it makes sense to
     take advantage of this feature to improve performance.
