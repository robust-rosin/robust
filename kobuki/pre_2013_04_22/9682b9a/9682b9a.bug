title: rqt_plot Failing When Kobuki Is Installed
description: >
     Starting the rqt_plot tool (a plotting GUI with plugins) resulted
     in a crash when Kobuki was also installed (for specific versions,
     and after a certain update to rqt_plot).
     The crash was due to the tool interpreting some resource paths
     relative to the XML file that defines the plugin, while its
     documentation stated that paths should be relative to the ROS
     package path.  Since most plugins had the XML file at the root of
     the package, this was not an issue. But Kobuki did not, and so
     the issue came up.
     In the end, the tool was changed to interpret all paths relative
     to the XML file, as was that the intended behaviour.
