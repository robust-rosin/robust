title: Use of Platform-specific Functions
description: >
     Kobuki's driver was making use of the deprecated `usleep`
     function, along with other sleep functions from `ctime`. For
     cross-platform support, these have been replaced with the sleep
     functions from the platform-independent `ecl` library.
