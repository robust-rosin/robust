title: Node Starts Normally Even When Robot Is Turned Off
description: >
     The Kobuki driver's node started normally even when the robot
     base was turned off. There was no indication of this, not even a
     warning.
     A watchdog was added to keep track of whether data is being
     received through the serial cable within a time limit.
