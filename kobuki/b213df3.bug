title: Missing Comment Token
description: >
     ROS parameters (key-value pairs) can be loaded from YAML files.
     One such file was missing a line comment token, causing part of
     the text to be interpreted as YAML data, and loaded as a ROS
     parameter.
     There was no crash or error report because the text happened to
     contain a colon, which made it valid YAML syntax for the parser.
     The end result was a strangely named parameter showing up during
     operation.
