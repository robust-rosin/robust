title: Add an Option to Reset Odometry Values
description: >
     The Kobuki plugin for Gazebo did not have an option to reset
     odometry values. Resetting odometry can be useful, for instance,
     to easily get the distance travelled by the robot from a specific
     reference point. This is also a feature that the real Kobuki has,
     so the simulation plugin should try to mimic it.
     The fix for this also fixed a small issue with IMU data
     processing, where some values were being recorded as zero,
     instead of the actual values.
