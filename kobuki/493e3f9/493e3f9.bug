title: Wrong Inertia and Center of Mass in Robot Description
description: >
     The URDF file for Kobuki's physical model assumed the center of
     mass to be in the center of the robot's cylinder body. This is
     wrong, since the battery was intentionally placed at the front of
     the robot to make it heavier at the front.
     The wrong placement of the robot's center of mass had the effect
     of having it constantly bouncing back and forth in the Gazebo
     simulator.
