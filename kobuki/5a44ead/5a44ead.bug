title: Program Finishing Too Soon
description: >
     One of the demo applications for Kobuki was supposed to
     initialize it and let it emit a beep sound, to signal that
     everything was working as intended. However, the robot would not
     emit any sound because the program was unintentionally
     terminating before it had time to read all the necessary data.
     Adding a `sleep` for some seconds fixed the issue.
