title: Use of Deprecated and Removed Features
description: >
     Kobuki's source code was using some features of the Boost
     libraries related to type casting that were marked as deprecated,
     and were later removed in a newer version of the libraries. This
     upgrade caused builds to fail. The fix was essentially a find and
     replace, since other (recommended) constructs existed to replace
     the deprecated ones.
