title: Missing Dependency Causes Setup to Fail
description: >
     Kobuki has a package, `kobuki_ftdi` which contains utilities for
     flashing and enabling Kobuki's USB connection. One such utility
     copies a udev rule to enable the device to appear on
     `/dev/kobuki`.
     When users install Turtlebot and Kobuki packages on their system,
     they often do so with the deb packages for Ubuntu. However,
     `kobuki_ftdi` was not included in the main package, and when the
     users got to the point where they would set up the udev rule, the
     process would fail, since `kobuki_ftdi` was not found.
     This package is clearly not a compile time nor runtime
     dependency, however the solution was to declare it as both, so
     that users would have to install the package anyway.
