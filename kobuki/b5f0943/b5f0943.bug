title: Converting Nodes to Nodelets
description: >
  ROS provides the concepts of node and nodelet. Nodes are the main
  entities, using OS processes and communicating through the
  network.  Nodelets are an optimization construct meant for nodes
  that are tightly coupled. They use threads instead, managed by a
  process called the nodelet manager.
  The big advantage of nodelets is that communication can happen by
  sharing references to the messages in memory, instead of going
  through serialization of every message sent.
  Kobuki features a number of nodes that are tightly coupled, and
  communicate at a reasonable frequency. Thus, it makes sense to
  take advantage of this feature to improve performance, as
  controllers can only be considered reactive if they provide timely
  responses to input messages. Nodelets facilitate this better than
  plain nodes.
