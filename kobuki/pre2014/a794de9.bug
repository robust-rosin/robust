title: Assertion Error When Running on 32-bit Platform
description: >
     Kobuki uses the Eigen library for linear algebra.  Some
     structures in Eigen need to be bit-aligned and some macros need
     to be present in the code for this to happen.  Adding the missing
     macros fixed most of the occurrences of the problem.
