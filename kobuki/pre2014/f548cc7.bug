title: Teleoperation Nodelet Crashing on Keyboard Input
description: >
     The Kobuki keyboard teleoperation nodelet, `kobuki_keyop`,
     crashed under two scenarios:
     1. when Ctrl+C was pressed during execution and the driver
     nodelet was not running;
     2. when any key was pressed during initialization.
     When this abrupt termination occurred, it also had side effects
     on the formatting of that terminal's output.
     The main issue for (1) was a lack of exception handlers to handle
     the interrupt signals during sleeps.
     Regarding (2), the thread that processes keyboard input was being
     spawned before all initialization operations were performed,
     leading to manipulation of uninitialized state if there was
     premature input to process. The fix also places thread start at
     the right time.
