title: Unexpected Movement Due to Wrong Calculation
description: >
     Kobuki moves using differential drive. Originally, the command
     velocities (linear and angular) were provided as `short`, and
     were converted to `short` after each step, even though the
     calculations yielded floating point numbers.
     This lead to calculation errors in some special cases, where the
     robot was supposed to move forward but ended up moving backwards
     instead.
