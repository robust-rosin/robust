title: The inactivity Timeout Was Too Long
description: >
     Kobuki has a parameter with the default timeout period for
     inactivity.  This means that if no commands are received within X
     seconds (where X is the parameter value), then the robot stops
     moving.
     This timeout had a very long value of 2 seconds, which allows for
     a diverse range of problematic scenarios.
