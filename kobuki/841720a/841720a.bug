title: Robot Reports Full Battery Before Charging It
description: >
  Just after connecting to the power adapter the robot would send a
  "battery charged" signal, and only after would it transition to
  the appropriate "charging" state.
  The issue is not in the ROS code, but in the firmware of the robot
  controller.
  The ROS side seems to be doing everything correctly, and the fix
  commit introduces new functionality that seems correct, but just
  appears to be malfunctioning as it essentially implements a 1-to-1
  transformation between robot internal state and a ROS message. As
  the robot's internal state is incorrectly being represented/reported
  by the robot controller's firmware, the ROS code produces seemingly
  "incorrect" messages (but they really aren't).
