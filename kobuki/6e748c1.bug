title: Process Hanging in Shutdown Sequence
description: >
     ROS provides the concept of node (a process) and nodelet -- a
     lightweight implementation using a thread instead. Nodelets can
     be aggregated under a manager process, and this enables nodelets
     under the same manager to share messages by reference, avoiding
     the cost of copy and serialization.
     The Kobuki base nodelet spawns an additional thread for its
     operation: one thread publishes messages at a specific rate, and
     another processes event callbacks.
     When the user requested shutdown by killing both the manager and
     the nodelet, no problems arose. If the user tried to shutdown
     just the nodelet, then it would hang in the shutdown sequence.
     The reason behind this behaviour was that the nodelet manager
     would try to destroy the nodelet object, but the destructor
     waited for the additional thread to finish. However, no signal
     would be sent to the helper thread, and it would keep working
     indefinitely.
     The solution for this problem was to add a "shutdown requested"
     flag that would be shared between threads. When the manager tries
     to destroy the nodelet object, the destructor signals the other
     thread through the flag and only then proceeds to wait.
