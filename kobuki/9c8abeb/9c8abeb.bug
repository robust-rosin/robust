title: Use of Deprecated and Removed Features
description: >
     Kobuki's source code was using some features of the Boost
     libraries related to type casting that were marked as deprecated,
     and were later removed in a newer version of the libraries. This
     upgrade caused builds to fail. The fix was essentially a find and
     replace, since other (recommended) constructs existed to replace
     the deprecated ones.

        An issue surfaced when building the Docker image, as it could
        not find tf2 packages. This was due to the repository being named
        `geometry_experimental` at the time this issue was reported, and
        having been renamed to `geometry2` later on. To fix this, the
        rosinstall file had to be patched manually. Cf. issue
        https://github.com/robust-rosin/robust/issues/63.
        An additional issue surfaced, also when building the Docker image.
        In this case, the package 'libpcl-1.7-all-dev' is reported as missing.
        This package is not distributed in the standard Ubuntu repositories
        for Ubuntu Precise, the distribution used to reproduce this bug.
