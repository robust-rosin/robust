title: Unknown Type Due to Missing Include
description: >
     The compiler complains about not knowing the type `uint16_t`,
     which is declared in `stdint.h`.
     The original code relied on another library (libusb-dev) to
     include the required header as a dependency, instead of including
     it directly.  This worked only for some systems.
