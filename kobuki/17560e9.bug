title: Compilation Error due to Missing File Inclusion
description: >
     When building the `yocs_navigator` package, a user experienced a
     C++ compilation error, stating that one of the header files was
     missing.  This header file declares some custom ROS messages.
     The ROS community uses CMake to declare compilation instructions,
     in order to build a ROS package. In CMake files, there is a
     macro/function to declare dependencies of a build target. A build
     target can be a library or an executable (e.g. a ROS
     node). CMake-generated makefiles ensure that the dependencies of
     a target are built before the target.
     In this case, a dependency was missing for the faulty build
     target.  The dependency generated custom ROS messages, among
     which was the missing file.
     In the end, it is possible that the file was not missing, but
     actually being built after the target (due to the missing
     dependency), causing the error.
