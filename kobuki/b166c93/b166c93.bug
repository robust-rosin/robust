title: Backporting a Bug Fix

description:
     A commit fixed an issue where a macro was being used instead of
     the proper function call to determine whether a value is NaN.
     This commit was meant for the ROS Kinetic version of the Kobuki
     driver, but the issue was present in the ROS Indigo version as
     well.  A user requested that this fix was backported for the
     Indigo version.
