title: Odometry Could Not Be Reset
description: >
  Odometry is the use of data from motion sensors to estimate
  change in position over time. The Kobuki driver has a function
  that is supposed to reset the odometry (bringing its position and
  rotation estimates back to zero). In this case, calling this
  function would not reset rotation at all, and the position would
  keep an offset.
  The cause for this bug is that IMU readings (for rotation) cannot
  be reset, and thus an offset had to be subtracted for every
  reading, after reset is called. Resetting the encoder readings
  (for position) is possible, but the observed offset came from
  accumulators that remained in another node, `robot_pose_ekf`.
  The Robot Pose EKF is used to estimate the 3D pose of a robot,
  based on (partial) pose measurements coming from different
  sources.  It uses an extended Kalman filter to combine various
  measurements.  The basic idea is to offer loosely coupled
  integration with different sensors, where sensor signals are
  received as ROS messages.
  Since `robot_pose_ekf` was not needed for Kobuki to provide
  correct odometry, the final solution also removed it from the
  launch sequences.
