title: Odometry Could Not Be Reset
description: >
     Odometry is the use of data from motion sensors to estimate
     change in position over time. The Kobuki driver has a function
     that is supposed to reset the odometry (bringing its position and
     rotation estimates back to zero). In this case, calling this
     function would not reset rotation at all, and the position would
     keep an offset.
     The cause for this bug is that IMU readings (for rotation) cannot
     be reset, and thus an offset had to be subtracted for every
     reading, after reset is called. Resetting the encoder readings
     (for position) is possible, but the observed offset came from
     accumulators that remained in another node, `robot_pose_ekf`.
     The Robot Pose EKF is used to estimate the 3D pose of a robot,
     based on (partial) pose measurements coming from different
     sources.  It uses an extended Kalman filter to combine various
     measurements.  The basic idea is to offer loosely coupled
     integration with different sensors, where sensor signals are
     received as ROS messages.
     Since `robot_pose_ekf` was not needed for Kobuki to provide
     correct odometry, the final solution also removed it from the
     launch sequences.
