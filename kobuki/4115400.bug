title: Multiple Simulated Robots Do Not Update Orientation
description: >
     When multiple Kobuki robots were spawned in the Gazebo simulator
     their translations would properly update their odometry, but
     rotations would not.
     The underlying issue was that every robot instance was using the
     same IMU sensor, instead of each having its own.
