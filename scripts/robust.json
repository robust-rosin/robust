Since CWE is primarily concerned with security, it is sometimes necessary to add your own new categories (without a number identifier) not covered by the taxonomy; e.g., dependency errors, type errors, and robotics-specific weaknesses. In many cases, multiple categories are applicable. You should then pick the most appropriate category."
