title: An exception thrown by delay function, when Time object not initialized
description: >
  The tf2_ros is a C++ package that is using the ros::Time object to sleep (a C++ object).  This object might not be initialized if running inside rospy (so from python API to ros).  In such case an exception is thrown and sleeping fails.
  The fix of the bug catches the exception and uses the wall clock time API to delay instead.
  The problem and the fix are ROS-specific.  However the issue of using uninitialized APIs due to configuration issues is a fairly general one.
  The PR is rather uninformative.  The best explanation can be found in the first link in the 'links' section.
