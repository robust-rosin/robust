title:
  Wrong matrix expression during computation of a geometrical transformation
description: >
  The transformation function doTransform uses the external KDL library to
  compute the transformation.  It first translates the transform to a KDL
  format and then performs a vector-matrix multiplication to compute a
  rotation.  Every (homogeneous) transformation matrix consists of a part that
  rotates and a part that translates.  The KDL::Frame::M method extracts the
  rotation matrix from the transformation.  A vector multiplied with this new
  matrix would thus only be rotated, and not translated.  Unfortunately, the
  call to the the KDL::Frame::M function is missing (mistakenly removed in pull
  request \#104).  The bug is fixed by re-inserting the call to M.

  This kind of issue could be easily met in other robotics platforms and
  systems (in fact it occurred in an expression in ROS that used entirely KDL,
  so orocos, API).

    The bug was introduced at pull request 104, and at that point the mainline
    contained a test that would detect the bug.  Thus the easiest way to
    reproduce this is to use the test suite with the test mentioned in pull
    request 106.
