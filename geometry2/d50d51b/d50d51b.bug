title: Wrongly initialized message structure

description:
  The static transform publisher would not initialize the message header when
  publishing messages with RPY arguments. The bug is unrelated to the geometric
  specification RPY angles, but it is a pure intialization bug that could
  appear in any communication protocol.  The hearder is not initialized with
  timestamp, and frame identifiers.

  The pull request also merged in a local name refactoring that appears
  unrelated.
