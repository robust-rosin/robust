title: Wrong logical condition for selecting targets of a message
description: >
  Static Transform Broadcaster uses a wrong condition in selecting messages to
  be send to notes (the condition is supposed to filter out duplicates).  This
  is a typical bug in logic of the program that does not really appear
  fixable/detectable without specification (for instance tests).  The developer
  producing the fix has also included a regression test.
