title: Wrong function name in Python import (wrong use)
description: >
  The code in tf2_sensor_msgs.py imports method read_cloud from
  sensor_msgs.point_cloud2.  This function does not exist though.  Instead
  read_points should have been imported.

  The code in do_transform_cloud in this module was not working for users
  before (apparently it had no users before the one who found the problem.).
  This should result in a runtime error when a call to do_transform_cloud is
  made.

  The merged commit fixes a few other minor issues with dependencies that are
  mostly introduced during fixing the main bug.  These are not described here.

  The fix has also exposed another bug (fixed in 26, link under links).

    Call do_transform_cloud.  An idea how to do this is also in the test
    included in the merged commit. So essentially the test is already
    available, perhaps just needs to be simplified.
