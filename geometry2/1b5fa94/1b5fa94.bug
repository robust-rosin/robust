title: Memory leak in Pythonâ€“C++ interface
description: >
  The problem appears in a C++ code which handles Python objects (the
  package which interfaces tf2 to Pyhton). Reference counting is used to
  handle memory allocation.

  The function `PyObject_SetAttrString()` does not transfer the ownership of
  the reference from an object which is to be set as an attribute to an
  object which receives the attribute. The reference count never reaches
  zero and consequently it is never deallocated. The fix adds explicit
  decrements of reference counters.

  The leak has been observed when robots are running for days. It can be
  reproduced with a rate of 15-20 MB leaked per second. From a security
  perspective, it may mean that a deployment crashes itself (without any
  hostile external action) by just running long enough.

  It seem that detection of such bugs can be automated by using tools to
  check against memory problems (like valgrind) or even by simply running
  longer tests and monitoring their memory usage.
