title: Wrong vector translation (violation of requirements spec)
description: >
  "Geometry distinguishes two types for a triple of numbers: Point and
  Vector3.  They have the same members but different semantics. Vectors have
  magnitude and direction but are always from the origin. Points have position.
  This explained, for instance, in issue 330, under links below. Since vectors
  are always rooted in origin, when a translation is applied to them, only the
  rotation part is taken into account, not the translation part, so that they
  remain rooted in the origin.

  The function 'do_transform_vector3' wrongly applies the translation to the
  argument as well (besides the rotation). This is fixed in the associated pull
  request, and a test is added that exposes the behaviour.

  This is a fairly general issue that could appear in any robotics framework,
  not just in ROS."
