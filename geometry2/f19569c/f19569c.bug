title: "One definition rule (ODR) violation in C++"
description: >
  Since 2003 C++ requires at most a single definition (don't confuse with
  declaration) for an identifier.  An exception is made for inline functions,
  as the rule is exploited to resolve overloading by names at at linking time
  (so inlined functions are not affected).

  Several tf2 modules had non-inline functions defined in a header file, which
  lead to multiple definitions (in every file that included the header). This
  has been rectified by qualifying the functions as inline.

  In general ODR violations can be symptoms of more serious dependency issues,
  name violation issues, name-space problems, or cut & paste programming. In
  this particular case, it seems that the violation was not harmful, and the
  "inline" modifier was mostly added to remove a compiler warning.

  The pull request has addressed also other unrelated issues, through several
  commits. The commit referenced below in the description is the one that fixes
  the ODR issue.

  The second link (under the 'links' key below) points to an interesting post
  from the gcc developer implementing the ODR checker. It lists problems
  and dangers, rationalizing the rule and the enforcement.
