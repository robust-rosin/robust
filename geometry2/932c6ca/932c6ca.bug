title: Use of retired class field
description: >
  tf2_ros uses the "__connection_header" field in ROS messages to get connection information.  This field has been phased out by the roscpp project, and for some time tf2_ros was not updated.  References to a non-existing field in C++ cause a build failure (reported by type and name analysis).
  This is a rather typical example of co-evolving projects getting out of sync.
  The pull request merged in this description has not been directly merged but it appears that the commit has been merged.
