title: Missing escape in a printf format string

description:
  'The logWarn macro takes a format string parameter in C printf style (it
  expands to a call to a console_bridge::log).  This macros is used in the
  BufferCore::setTransform function to produce a message containing a URL to a
  page with possible diagnostic information.  The link contains a verbatim
  string "%20e" which is interpreted by the log function as a format string
  that emits a floating point number in an exponential notation.

  This causes two problems: first the warning message is broken (the link is
  malformed), second an unsafe memory access happens during log execution---the
  argument list of a variadic function is accessed beyond its length. This
  likely accesses the stack beyond the argument part of the stack frame of the
  function, and (most likely) the return address of the call is being printed
  as the floating point number. This may be a security vulnerability.

  The bug is fixed by escaping the % character in the URL (%%).

  NB. Not much later in the history the logWarn macro has been renamed, so
  locating the bug in git history requires precision.

  The bug has been fixed in indigo, and then the same fix has been merged back
  into hydro development.  This means that the bug has been found when the new
  release work was already started.

  The first link below links to the discussion leading to renaming of logWarn.
  The second one is the pull request that fixes the same issue in the hydro
  branch.'
