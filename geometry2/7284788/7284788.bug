title: A loop stop condition works well with C++ but not with Python access
description: >
  A loop in tf2_ros/src/buffer.cpp depends on ros::ok evaluation to check whether
  the system has not stopped.  This works fine if the C++ version of tf is accessed.  However,
  if the canTransform function is called from the python API (pytf)  ros::ok may be
  not initialized. This immediately terminates the loop and as a result the waitForTransform
  function never waits for the transform being available but terminates with a generic
  uninformative exception. The bug seems to have been fixed, by ignoring the check
  for pytf (sic!).
  The issue is primarily seen from the tf (not tf2) access, exposed there, because
  tf has been reimplemented as a wrapper around tf2 at some point, for backwards compatibility.
  This issue is very idiosyncratic to ROS and tf2, but it is an interesting case of
  inconsistency of the API between Python and C++ (accessing the same C++ function).  In
  that sense it is also slightly related to bug ede2646 in the collection. It might
  be interesting to metamorphic testing research, among others.
