description:
  Most likely a NULL pointer dereference bug.  Precise place hard to establish before we reproduce it. Andrzej has a candidate location, but does not bother to describe before we can reproduce it.
classification: "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference"
keywords:
  - pointer
  - "null"
system: core component
severity: error

bug:
  phase: runtime-operation
  specificity: general issue
  architectural-location: platform code
  application: N/A
  task: N/A
  subsystem: generic task component
  package: ros/geometry2/tf2
  languages:
    - C++

  issue: N/A

  reproducibility: sometimes
  trace:
    - TODO check out test/simple_tf2_core.cpp for how to set up a trace. Then
    - TODO there is some inspiration on how to us allFramesAsYAML in speed_test.cpp (commented out, but shows context)
    - it appears that calling BufferCore::lookupOrInsertFrameNumber with some messy string will put a NULL object in the back that should cause the trouble.
    - after that call allFramesAsYAML and insert an assertion just before line 1337 (see also whether it crashes immediately after )
