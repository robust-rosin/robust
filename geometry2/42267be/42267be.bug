title: Missing include directories for console_bridge
description: >
  The tf2 package mistakenly does not declare include directories for one of
  the dependencies (console_bridge).  This causes a build failure under some
  circumstances (in an isolated build).  Otherwise the include directories
  happen to be appended to the include path by other packages, and the build
  will not fail.

  An isolated build is typically used in an automatic setup (for instance
  continuous integration) while a regular build tends to be used by developers
  on desktop.  This is why this build bug likely got into the repository.
