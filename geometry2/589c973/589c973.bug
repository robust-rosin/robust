title: Missing const qualifier on a C++ function with no side effects
description: >
    The tf2::Vector3.rotate() function computes a rotation of a vector by an angle around an axis.  It is a pure function that does not modify the object state. It should thus have a const modifier to allow calling it from other const functions---otherwise the typechecker stops compilation.
    This bug will be reported not when typechecking the file in question, but when typechecking a const method in user code (so the fault and failure locations are different).
