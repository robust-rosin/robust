title: Access out of bounds to std::vector

description:
  An accessor to the frame buffer (BufferCore::getFrame) accesses the frames
  buffer possibly one position outside of bounds due to an off-by-one error.

  The access to std::vector instances using the indexing operator [ ] in the
  C++ standard library does not incur out of bounds checks for performance
  reasons (the 'at' method does).

  The error has been found by triaging a double free bug. It is not clear
  however whether this problem is related to double-free.  The original double
  free issue (in links below) has not been closed at the time of this data
  collection. The second link below, points to the fixing commit.
