title: Missing dependencies on python_orocos_kdl in the package manifest
description: >
  tf2_gemoetry_msgs misses to declare build-time and run-time dependencies on
  python interface to orocos_kdl library.  This may cause a build  error for
  the package if built on a system where these libraries are not installed
  (presumably when tests involving messages are run). Runtime crashes will
  occur  in python client code that tries to use geometry messages.

  We classify this as a run-time dependency issue, as this is a more serious
  aspect here. The issue is ROS-specific, given that package.xml is a
  ROS-specific dependency mechanism.  However, the problem of missing
  build-time and run-time dependencies is general and could appear in many
  software systems.

        The PUT is a Python image, so even though technically this could be
        classified as a build failure / problem, the workspace will build
        as only at runtime the missing package will cause actual problems.
