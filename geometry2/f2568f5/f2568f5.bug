title: Missing runtime dependency on python_orocos_kdl in the package manifest
description: >
  A runtime dependency on python_orocos_kdl is missing in package
  tf2_sensor_msgs. Fixed by adding it to package.xml.

  This is a fairly general issue (runtime dependency) but it appears in a
  ROS-specific setup of handling dependencies. It will manifest in a runtime
  crash of client code. It was exposed by a regression test added for another
  problem (linked below).
