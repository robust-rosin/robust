title: An unusual use of C-style format string causes a static analysis warning
description: >
  The two macros, TF2_ROS_MESSAGEFILTER_DEBUG and TF2_ROS_MESSAGEFILTER_WARN call another macro (ROS_DEBUG_NAMED, respectively ROS_WARN_NAMED).  The second argument of these ROS_* macros is a printf-style format string.  Both calls use a "%s" formatter inside this format string, which causes the next string to be inlined.  The problem is that these next string is also a format string in the same style, and this triggers (confuses) a gcc static analyzer that checks correctness of format strings and the following variable length argument list.  The fix is to change the macro to constract the a single format string first, before calling ROS_DEBUG_NAMED (ROS_WARN_NAMED).

  This kind of issue could be found in any reasonably complex C/C++ system using preprocessor macros.
