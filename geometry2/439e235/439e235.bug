title: A geometrical calculation error
description: >
  In the calculation of shortest angle represented by a quaternion in tf2
  the positive and negative cases are swapped.  Interestingly, this code has
  been originally cloned from Bullet LinearMath library, where it has been
  fixed later.  This bug is a great example of difficulties of clone & own,
  instead of depending on external components (not saying that this would be
  a better choice here).

  This is a robotics-specific issue as this calculation is common to
  geometrical modeling libraries.

    A test case should be fairly easy to create by comparing the branching
    before and after the fix.
