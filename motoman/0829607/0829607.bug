title: SDA10f model meshes are malformed
description: >
     When loading the SDA10F robot model in rviz, it shows the warning
     that the single meshes are 'malformed', because they start with
     the word 'solid' to indicate it is an ASCII file, but it does not
     contain the word 'endsolid'.
