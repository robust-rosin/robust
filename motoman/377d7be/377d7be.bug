title: Error message when installing Inform Code in DX200
description: >
     The Motoman controller has to be prepared for use with ROS.
     For this, you have to first install MotoPlus on the controller
     and afterwards a special INFORM Code. The motoman driver
     specifies a required handshake between the native INFORM robot
     code and the MotoRos layer. The MotoRos code will automatically
     run an INFORM job called INIT_ROS at the start of a motion
     command, which will provide the required handshaking.  When
     installing the INFORM Code to a DX200, it shows an error: L:****)
     ERROR 3200 : NOP or END instruction not found (J:INIT_ROS
