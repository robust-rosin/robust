title: Motoman starts next command after pausing it
description: >
     A stop_motion command or an empty trajectory command will make the robot
     stop. But if another message comes in afterwards, the robot will simply
     execute this next command.  There is no way to 'pause' the robot and wait
     for a 'go' again.
