title: Motoman starts next command after pausing it
description: >
  A stop_motion command or an empty trajectory command will make the robot
  stop. But if another message comes in afterwards, the robot will simply
  execute this next command.  There is no way to 'pause' the robot and wait
  for a 'go' again.
