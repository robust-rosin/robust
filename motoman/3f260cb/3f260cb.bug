title: Motoman robot can move after estop release
description: >
     The problem occurs in the following scenario: Running the Motoman
     ROS-Init program and starting a process that sends a trajectory
     to the Motoman driver and move the robot. Estop the robot on the
     teach pendant. Pull up the estop. Send a new trajectory. The
     robot will turn on and move.  This is very unsafe and dangerous.
