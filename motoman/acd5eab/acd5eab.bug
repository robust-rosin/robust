title: Setup Validation for MotoROS logic wrong
description: >
  The installation of MotoROS for the Controller is checked by a
  validation file. This validation returns a warning to contact
  Yaskawa support after a couple of resets instead of showing them
  after the first reboot, if some parameters are wrong.
