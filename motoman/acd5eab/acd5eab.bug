title: Setup Validation for MotoROS logic wrong
description: >
     The installation of MotoROS for the Controller is checked by a
     validation file. This validation returns a warning to contact
     Yaskawa support after a couple of resets instead of showing them
     after the first reboot, if some parameters are wrong.
