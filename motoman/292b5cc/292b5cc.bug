title: Incorrect response from FS100 to a control request
description: >
     The FS100 is one of the robot controllers by Motoman that are
     open to be used with ROS. From ROS side one can send a request
     for a motion and the controller will respond within a
     MOTO_MOTION_CTRL message. In some cases the field robot_id and
     sequence are set to -1. This is from the controller interpreted
     as unsigned leading to response as 0xFFFFFFFF.
