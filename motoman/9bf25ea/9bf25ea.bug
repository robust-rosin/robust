title: Incorrect values for frame transform between two robot links
description: >
     The transform from link_t to tool0 in sia20 package is in reality
     -pi.  In the robot description file it is rounded to -3.1416,
     which leads to an offset of 3 degree difference from the real
     robot to the description.
