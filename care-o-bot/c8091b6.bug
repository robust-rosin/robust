title: Missing dependencies to an external library
description: >
     The file package.xml is essential for every ROS package and it
     contains among others the dependencies of the packages.  In this
     example the dependency on "pynotify" is missing in the rosdep
     list and thus, there is an error by installing the package from
     apt-get install.  This could be solved by removing the
     dependencies inside the python script, which was using the
     library, since it was not required anymore. Otherwise, one would
     have needed to add the dependency to the package.xml.
