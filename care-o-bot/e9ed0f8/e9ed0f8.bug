title: Undeclared transitive dependencies to an external library
description: >
     The file package.xml is essential for every ROS package and it
     contains among others the dependencies of the packages. CMakeList
     is also essential for every ROS package and it contains the
     information of the packages, which is needed for the buildsystem.
     In this example the dependency on "joint_limits_interface" is
     missing in the rosdep list and thus, the package could not be
     installed by "rosdep install --from-path -i -y src".  The main
     problem was an undeclared transitive dependency in
     gazebo_ros_control package.
     This could be solved by adding the dependency to the package.xml
     with the lines:
     <build_depend>joint_limits_interface</build_depend>
     <run_depend>joint_limits_interface</run_depend>
     ...and to CMakeList with the lines:
     catkin_package(... joint_limits_interface ...).
