title: Missing dependencies to gencpp, which is important for ROS messages and services
description: >
     CMakeList is essential for every ROS package and it contains the
     information of the packages, which is needed for the buildsystem.
     If you have a target which depends on some other target you need
     to add an explicit dependency so that they are built in the
     correct order.
     In the example the node "cob_obstacle_distance" depends on
     "cob_obstacle_distance_gencpp". Gencpp is apparently a helper
     when adding some msgs as dependencies to a target node.  However,
     the node was linking to "cob_srvs_gencpp" which might have been
     correct at a former time (Apparently, the package has been
     renamed).  This could be solved by naming the dependency
     "${PROJECT_NAME}_gencpp". The "PROJECT_NAME" corresponds to the
     package name and thus, one can have a generic name, which is
     independent of the package name.
