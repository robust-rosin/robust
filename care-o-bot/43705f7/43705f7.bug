title: Topic names not consistent between hardware and simulation
description: >
     In ROS it is possible to work equivalent with hardware and
     simulation(in Gazebo).  A camera can be simulated in Gazebo with
     a plugin. This plugin has parameters which can be set in the URDF
     or Xacro. One parameter is e.g. the topic-name on which it
     publishes the image.  The real robot uses topic-names which are
     defined in the driver-node for the camera.  Therefore, one has to
     make sure to use consistent naming conventions to assure the
     exchangability between hardware and simulation.  In the example
     the camera topics in simulation do not match the topic names on
     real hardware.  The problem is solved by introducing consistent
     naming.
