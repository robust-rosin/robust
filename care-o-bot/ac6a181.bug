title: Missing dependencies to an external library
description: >
     The file package.xml is essential for every ROS package and it
     contains among others the dependencies of the packages.  In this
     example the dependency on "ipython" is missing in the rosdep list
     and thus, there should be an error by e.g. installing the package
     from apt-get install.  This could be solved by adding the
     dependency to the package.xml with the line
     <run_depend>ipython</run_depend>.
