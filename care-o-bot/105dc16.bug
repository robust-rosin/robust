title: Missing dependencies to gencpp, which is important for ROS messages and services
description: >
     CMakeList is essential for every ROS package and it contains the
     information of the packages, which is needed for the buildsystem.
     If you have a target which depends on some other target you need
     to add an explicit dependency so that they are built in the
     correct order.
     In the example the node "output_publisher" depends on
     "cob_srvsgencpp", but the dependency was missing.  Gencpp is
     apparently a helper when adding some msgs as dependencies to a
     target node.  This could be solved by naming the dependency
     "cob_srvs_gencpp". Even better would be to name it
     "${PROJECT_NAME}_gencpp". The "PROJECT_NAME" corresponds to the
     package name and thus, one can have a generic name, which is
     independent of the package name.
