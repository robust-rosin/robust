title: Xacro broken because of missing argument
description: >
     A xacro can reference to other xacros with the ability to pass
     arguments. In the example a child-xacro was changed by adding an
     additional argument. However, the parent-xacro (includes the
     edited child-xacro) was not updated. Therefore it misses the
     newly introduced argument. The consequence is that the xacro is
     broken and one can not generate an Urdf out of it anymore.  In
     the example the child-xacro is named "schunk_pg70", the parent
     "cob3-9" and the new argument is "has_podest".  The reason for
     this issue is that there are several parent-xacro using the
     child-xacro and one needs to update all the parent-xacros, which
     has been forgotten in the example.  The problem was solved by
     adding the newly introduced argument to the parent-xacro at the
     respective call of the child-xacro.
