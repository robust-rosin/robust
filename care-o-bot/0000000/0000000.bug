title: Individual ROS-packages of Metapackage are outdated on local system
description: >
     The motor for the tray of CoB-3 is not moving. The reason for the
     error is that certain ROS packages are outdated on the local
     system. This happened since updating the metapackage does not
     update the individual packages. Metapackages are specialized
     Packages in ROS (and catkin). They do not install files (other
     than their package.xml manifest) and they do not contain any
     files usually found in packages. A metapackage simply references
     one or more related packages which are loosely grouped together.
     In this example the metapackage used is "ros_control" and the
     outdated packages are "controller_manager" and
     "hardware_interface".  This error could be fixed by updating the
     outdated ROS packages.
