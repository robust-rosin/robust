title: Specifications of dimensions of a robot arm are not reflecting real dimensions
description: >
     URDF is an XML-based modeling language in which robot physical
     models are described. As robots are often produced in families of
     similar devices, it is convenient to parameterize this models.
     ROS uses the XACRO language to write parameterized models.  XACRO
     files are preprocessed to generate instantiated URDF files.
     In this particular case, a XACRO file contained physical
     dimensions of the UR10 robots that were inconsistent with those
     stored in the native software of Universal Robots (and also
     inconsistent with the documentation data). This means that the
     robot visualized in the visualization tool Rviz and used in
     simulation behaved differently than the real robot.  This poses
     an issue for testing and quality assurance.
     The issue is specific to ROS as it occurs in a ROS specific
     modeling language (URDF/XACRO).  However the same problem would
     naturally appear in any robotics framework, just in a different
     language.
     The discussion has started on the mailing list, and then have
     been promoted to the issue tracker, and referred from a larger
     pull requests that also improves other visual issues with URDF
     files, and reorganizes the files, so many aspects of the linked
     commit do not pertain to this bug.
     The same patch also fixes some potentially interesting issues
     with mass and inertia of the robot elements.
