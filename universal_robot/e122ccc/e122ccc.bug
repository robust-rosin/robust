title: Missing runtime dependency to run UR robots Gazebo simulation
description: >
     The moveit_simple_controller_manager package is not installed due
     to missing runtime dependencies in MoveIt configuration files for
     ur robots.
     The issue has been reported by the universal_robot driver user
     who merely tried to follow the readme instructions how to start
     up gazebo-based simulation.  Starting the simulation results in a
     runtime exception from python about a missing module.  This kind
     of problems are hard to track for developers who often have all
     the dependencies installed.  However a continuous integration
     setup would usually build from scratch detecting most of such.
     The issue is ROS-specific as it appears in ROS-specific
     package.xml files.  However, the issue of missing runtime
     dependencies overall, is a general software-engineering issue.
