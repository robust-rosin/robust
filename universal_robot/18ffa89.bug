title: An error in physical robot specification
description: >
     A Xacro file refers to wrong wrist of the robot, which results in
     a wrong physical model being used for simulation.
     A robotics application needs a description of the physical
     appearance, shape, etc. of the robot.  This is used, among
     others, by the simulation tools.  The robot descriptions are
     stored in URDF files, an XML format. Xacro files are URDF files
     enriched with macros, mostly for better code reuse (so that
     similar parts of the robot can be generated).
     This particular URDF file is specific to the Gazebo physics
     simulator.  It does not actually define the robot shape. It
     decorates a robot model from another file with properties
     specific to this simulation engine.
     The error seems to be minor. The color of the wrist might be
     wrong as a result (it is unclear whether the effect of gravity on
     this wrist will also be wrong, which could be problematic; or
     perhaps whether this wrist could disappear).
     The error appeared by copying and pasting, presumably during
     adapting a description of smaller variant of the same robot, for
     a bigger version.
     The file has been created on April 8, 2013.  The fix was
     committed on Jun 4, 2013. The repository in which this work has
     been done, seems to be deleted by now.  The bug was on 57 days,
     but it was fixed before merging into ros-industrial repositories.
