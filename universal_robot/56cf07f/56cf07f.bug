title: Missing specifications for installation of UR packages
description: >
  The build specification for five ur packages (ur_bringup,
  ur_description, ur_driver, ur_gazebo, ur_kinematics) are missing
  declaration of target directories for installation.  As an effect
  installation using catkin is not possible
  The Groovy version of ROS introduced a new build system (catkin)
  over the legacy rosbuild used before.  This is why the errors are
  only reported for groovy-dev --- these are errors in the newly
  created build files.
  This is reported as one bug, but technically these are five
  almost identical problems in five packages of the universal_robot
  repository.
  Apparently due to git mishandling PR14, linked below, was not
  merged, but an identical PR19 was merged directly later on.
  This issue is specific to catkin, which is the build system used
  only in ROS.  It is based on CMake, used somewhat more widely,
  though.  However, lack of deployment specification is a general
  software engineering issue.
