title: Missing specifications for installation of UR packages
description: >
     The build specification for five ur packages (ur_bringup,
     ur_description, ur_driver, ur_gazebo, ur_kinematics) are missing
     declaration of target directories for installation.  As an effect
     installation using catkin is not possible
     The Groovy version of ROS introduced a new build system (catkin)
     over the legacy rosbuild used before.  This is why the errors are
     only reported for groovy-dev --- these are errors in the newly
     created build files.
     This is reported as one bug, but technically these are five
     almost identical problems in five packages of the universal_robot
     repository.
     Apparently due to git mishandling PR14, linked below, was not
     merged, but an identical PR19 was merged directly later on.
     This issue is specific to catkin, which is the build system used
     only in ROS.  It is based on CMake, used somewhat more widely,
     though.  However, lack of deployment specification is a general
     software engineering issue.
