title: An attempt to read a flag beyond 32-bits
description: >
     The universal_robot driver controls the rebots with help of
     scritps (prog) written in a proprietary lanugage developed by
     Universal Robots (URScript).
     The prog script used in the driver reads flags consecutively to
     send them forwards starting with 0 to 32. However the vector of
     flags has only 32 bits, so the last flag does not exist.  This
     causes the simulator of the universal robot to complain with a
     warning.  The actual robot does not appear to be affected.
     The issue is general. It is a typical overflow/one-off error when
     accessing an indexed resource. It appears in a language that is
     specific to the robot in question, and entirely independent of
     ROS.
