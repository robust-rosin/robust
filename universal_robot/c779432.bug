title: required C++11 compiler
description: >
     The geometric_shapes package (from moveit) started to use C++11
     features, more precisely the shared pointer type that clashes
     with a similar type in the Boost library.  The geometry shapes
     headers were updated to include a check if a C++11 compiler is
     used, and fail with an error otherwise.
     This issue could appear in any complex projects which mixes
     versions of the programming language (here C++).
