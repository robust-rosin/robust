title: ur_gazebo depends on gazebo_ros_pkgs meta-package
description: >
     The ur_gazebo package, which is a proper package depends on a
     meta-package (just a grouping package) gazebo_ros_pkgs, which is
     not allowed by ROS packaging standards.  Instead it should depend
     on concrete packages that it actually uses.  See REP-127 linked
     below; "Catkin packages must depend directly on the packages they
     use, not on any metapackages." (section <metapackage/>). This
     causes the build error with the current version of catkin that
     enforces this rule.
     The bug is fixed by removing the runtime dependency on
     gazebo_ros_pkgs and replacing it with a dependency on
     controller_manager, which seems tot be the actual package needed.
     Meta-packages in ROS are used to install a number of packages
     working together (and having actual contents) to be conveniently
     installed together, while tracking all dependencies.  They cannot
     export dependencies further, so they should only be used to
     install groups of packages together by a package manager, not by
     other packages to depend on them.
     The issue is ROS-specific as it appears in ROS-specific
     package.xml files.  Moreover it arises due to the enforcement of
     a ROS-specific packaging decision.
