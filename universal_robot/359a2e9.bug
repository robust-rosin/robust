title: Controller reads too many bytes for IO message
description: >
     The controller reads more from the socket than the size of the
     message. This is not always a problem, as often messages are
     processed one a time, and there is nothing more available to
     read.  However in many-message scenarios (like executing a
     trajectory) this leads to errors, as remaining messages are read
     with an offset (incomplete gibberish).
     The bug occurs in the code running on the robot that is uploaded
     there by ROS.  This code is written in a prioprietary language
     URScript.
     The bug appears in universal-robot-specific language, but
     overreading is a standard issue, that could be seen in many
     software systems.
     The first pull request was closed without merging, but a large
     (the second) pull request included the same change.
