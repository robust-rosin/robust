title: Missing runtime dependency on another package (industrial robot simulator)
description: >
     The universal robot planner (moveit) module lacks a runtime
     dependency on the industrial robot simulator.  This leads to a
     runtime error (presumably).
     This bug has been repeated in multiple drivers. All industrial
     moveit_config packages use the industrial_robot_simulator, but
     don't declare a runtime dependency on it.  Affected robots
     include ABB, Fanuc, Motoman, Universal Robot.
