title: dependency on ros_controllers metapackage
description: >
     The ur_gazebo package, which is a proper package, depends on a
     meta-package (just a grouping package) ros_controllers, which is
     not allowed by ROS packaging standards.  Instead they should
     depend on concrete packages that they actually use.  See REP-127
     linked below; "Catkin packages must depend directly on the
     packages they use, not on any metapackages." (section
     <metapackage/>). This causes the build error with the current
     version of catkin that enforces this rule.
     This dependency is (moreover) stale, and can simply be removed.
     Meta-packages in ROS are used to install a number of packages
     working together (and having actual contents) to be conveniently
     installed together, while tracking all dependencies.  They cannot
     export dependencies further, so they should only be used to
     install groups of packages together by a package manager, not by
     other packages to depend on them.
     The issue is ROS-specific as it appears in ROS-specific
     package.xml files.  Moreover it arises due to the enforcement of
     a ROS-specific packaging decision.
     This essentially the same bug as 0c34123 and a58f4b5
