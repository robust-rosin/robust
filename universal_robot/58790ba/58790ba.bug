title: Runtime dependencies missing in a Python driver module
description: >
     The ur_driver package manifest (package.xml) lacks a runtime
     dependency on the python parser beatifulsoup.  As an effect the
     build and installation procedure does not install/require the
     right python package.  Since package loading is dynamic in python
     the dependency is only reported when one attempts to start the
     ur5 driver node.
     The package manifest is an XML file called package.xml that must
     be included with any catkin-compliant package's root folder. This
     file defines properties about the package such as the package
     name, version numbers, authors, maintainers, and dependencies on
     other catkin packages. (from ROS wiki)
     The patch contains also fix for build-time and run-time
     dependencies on trajectory_msgs package, which were also missing.
     The issue is ROS-specific as it appears in ROS-specific
     package.xml files.  However, the issue of missing runtime
     dependencies overall, is a general software-engineering issue.
