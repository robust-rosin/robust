title: Syntax error in a robot script
description: >
     The bug occurs in the code running on the robot that is uploaded
     there by ROS.  This code is written in a prioprietary language
     URScript. The entire program (ur_driver/prog) consists of one
     top-level function 'driverProg'.  After this program, there was
     one toplevel call to this function, which was not required
     (indeed not allowed) by the syntax of URScript.  The language's
     semantics by default performs this call to the only existing
     function upon function definition.
     The parser for URScript produces a parsing error, but the
     language is permissive and the program continuous to execute as
     if the line was not there.  Thus the impact on the execution of
     the robot is negligible (just a message).
     This is an encoding error in the sense that the program sent to
     UR robot is incorrect sytnactically (so this is analogous to
     sending any other malformed message), but note that this program
     is not synthesized by the driver, but coded statically.
     Malformed script execution in a dynamic interpreted language is a
     general software defect that could appear in many other
     languages.
