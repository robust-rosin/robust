title: Path planning exceeding velocity limits of ur5
description: >
     This problem is caused by inconsistency between parameters in
     different parts of the driver (or application).
     The ROS planner (MoveIt!) plans with the velocity limits
     specified in joint_limits.yaml, which are retried from a physical
     description of the robot in URDF files (see limit tag for
     instance in
     https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/hydro-devel/ur_description/urdf/ur5.urdf.xacro#L105).
     This velocities are specified per joint.
     The driver (ur_driver) has its own velocity limit.  This limit is
     specified globally. It has been introduced privately and used for
     testing and debugging purposes.  The driver stops the motion if
     the velocity exceeds the maximum.
     In the reported issue the planner finds plan that exceed join
     veloctity of 2 rad/s which was the default limit in the
     ur_driver.  As a fix the developers set the internal driver limit
     to to infinite (10 rad/s is considered much higher than the
     actual velocity physically possible with UR5).
     This allows the faster plans to be executed.  If safety is
     violated, the safety function of the robot performs a safety stop
     (on the robot side).
     Also a possibility of setting the parameter from the launch file
     has been added (but this is additional functionality, not a bug
     fix).
