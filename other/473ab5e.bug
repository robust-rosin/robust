title: component not correctly initialized at activation
description: >
     A robot is providing an interface for pose-based control, i.e.,
     it is ready to receive 6d pose request to move the robot.  Among
     the different ways to produce the pose target, the one of
     interest is deduced from user input provided by a joystick
     interface.  This component reads at launch the current pose of
     the robot, and waits then for joystick input to produce some
     motion requests.
     But if the robot is moved through other means, the joystick-based
     pose commands does not get the current robot pose updated. It is
     indeed only set at the component creation.  Thus, when the
     joystick-based pose generator is activated and receive joystick
     input, the target pose updated may be based on an old pose of the
     robot end effector, so that the robot will move back to a
     previous (and potentially far) pose.
