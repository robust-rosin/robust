title: Image from the Kinect v2 is flipped
description: >
     The Kinect v2 is a camera providing images and depth data. The
     driver Freenect2 is used to access the images from that
     device. By default, the images provided by the camera + Freenect2
     driver are "mirrored" or flipped by the vertical axis, which is
     not standard and/or expected by the application using the images.
