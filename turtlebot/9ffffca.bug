title: Node Does Not Support Namespaces
description: >
     A velocity smoother node for Kobuki's teleoperation was being
     used with remappings to global topic names.  A global name
     (starts with "/") does not change with ROS name resolution, which
     makes setups very inflexible.
     If a user wants to launch multiple robots, or simply launch a
     robot within a specific namespace, topic names may clash or end
     up disconnected.
     The use of global names is not a recommended practice, and
     relative names should be used instead.
