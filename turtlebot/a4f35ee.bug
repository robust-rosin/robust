title: Launch File Not Working With Some Linux Distributions
description: >
     One of Turtlebot's launch files launched a component that
     performed custom operative system checks, and crashed when it
     encountered Linux Mint and Linux Linaro.  ROS is tested and
     recommended for Ubuntu systems, and Linux Mint is a distribution
     based on Ubuntu that shares a great deal of its packages, and, in
     general, should not cause problems running ROS.
     The check for the Linux distribution name not being equal to Ubuntu,
     results in an exception being thrown.
