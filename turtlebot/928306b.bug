title: No Laptop Battery Information Displaying
description: >
     Turtlebot's dashboard application features an indicator for the
     remaining charge of the laptop controlling the robot.
     After an upgrade to more recent OS versions and laptops, this
     indicator stopped displaying information. This was due to a
     change in the OS layer where the battery information was moved,
     and thus the script that looked for it could not find it in the
     old location.
