title: Environment Hooks Introduce Undocumented Dependency
description: >
     ROS packages can make use of environment hooks -- shell scripts
     that are executed, for instance, to set up environment variables.
     In ROS Indigo, the core Turtlebot package introduced an
     environment hook that depended on another package that was not
     listed as a dependency in the package manifest. This caused error
     messages to be printed to the terminal if the user did not have
     the package installed.
     The fix was to move the faulty parts of the environment hook to
     the package they depended on.
