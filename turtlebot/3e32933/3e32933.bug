title: Image Processing Sometimes Does Not Receive Data
description: >
     One of Turtlebot's launch files launches a node that processes
     depth images and converts the point cloud data to a laser
     scan. This node had remappings that expected the images to arrive
     on a specific topic.
     However, depending on whether some options were set, the correct
     topic name could change. This scenario was not foreseen, and
     under those circumstances the node would not receive any images
     to process.
     The fix leveraged the ability to define conditional values in
     launch files to account for the different cases.

    note: >
        This is an L2 reproduction.
        The original launch file starts nodes that rely on hardware, but are not
        relevant to illustrate the bug and the fix themselves.
        As such, the bug_witness.test in this case contains a slice of the
        original launch file, and the buggy and fixed versions are different.
