Creating a BugZoo snapshot
--------------------------

In this document, we provide instructions for creating a BugZoo snapshot for
a particular bug within this dataset. Note that these instructions are
intended for the maintainers of the ROBUST dataset, and not for end-users of
ROBUST.

1.  Identify the package to which the bug belongs (e.g., `kobuki`), then create
    a subdirectory to hold all files for the bug within the directory for that package
    (e.g., `kobuki/eed104d`). For the remainder of these instructions, the newly
    created directory for the bug will be referred to as the *bug directory*.
